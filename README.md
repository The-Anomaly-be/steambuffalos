Convert Steam empty space to buffalos pastures when the Steam window is maximized. I submitted it to Steam but I don't know if it will be accepted ;)

Based on this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mioeon/please_let_me_zoom_in_thats_all_i_ask_for/ by RandomHero2403

Use: Launch the .exe(located in the dist directory), whenever the Steam app windows is maximized, the empty space is converted in pasture and buffalos appear. To exit the app, go in your tray icons, right click on the buffalo one and click on "Quit". That's All! 

Change the picture: You can replace the buffalo.png image by any other transparent png to have it benefit from that big unused space. There are a few images in the other_images folder.

All the images provided are my own creations and available to everyone under creative commons.

What's the catch? None. Check the code and generate the .exe yourself if you want (with pyexe or any other tool). I just have a lot of time on my hand (And I needed to learn how to release something on Steam before releasing my very first game, which is almost finished).
